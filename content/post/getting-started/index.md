title: The Economic Burden of Snakebites in Uganda- An Invisible but serious Concern.
---


## **The Hidden Cost of Snakebites in Uganda.**

Snakes are a common sight in Uganda and snakebites have become a growing health concern, especially in Eastern Uganda. In recent years, the number of reported snakebite cases has increased, with Kamuli district recording one of the highest cases in the country.
However, there is limited information available on the economic impact of snakebites in rural Uganda.

A recent study showed that a majority of the population had low knowledge on snakebite management and preferred traditional treatments over modern medical treatment. This leads to adverse health outcomes and added costs that have not yet been documented.

The health care system in Uganda is also facing challenges with the availability of expensive antivenoms and limited skills among health workers in the management of snakebites. This forces individuals to pay out of pocket for treatment, exacerbating health inequities and affecting the most vulnerable communities.

To address this issue, a study is needed to estimate the economic burden of snakebites in Kamuli and Iganga districts of Eastern Uganda, including the distribution, Catastrophic Health Expenditures, direct, and indirect costs of snakebite envenoming. With this information, the government and other stakeholders can develop **cost-effective interventions to prevent and manage snakebites** in the country.
